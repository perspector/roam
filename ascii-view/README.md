# ASCII View

A command-line tool that displays images as colorized ASCII art in the terminal.

## Features
- **Multi-format support**: Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, and other common image formats via [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- **Color terminal output**: Uses ANSI color codes for colors
- **Intelligent resizing**: Scales images to fit the terminal's constrained dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Terminal-optimized**: Adjusts for typical terminal font aspect ratios (characters are taller than they are wide)
- **Edge enhancement**: Uses Sobel filtering to enhance edges

## Building

This project can be built with Make:
```bash
# Development version
make

# Release version compiled with optimizations
make release
```

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

Requirements:
- C99-compatible compiler (GCC, Clang)
- Make build system

## Usage

```bash
./ascii-view <path/to/image> [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `-mw <width>`: Maximum width in characters (default: terminal width OR 64)
- `-mh <height>`: Maximum height in characters (default: terminal height OR 48)
- `-et <threshold>`: Edge detection threshold, range: 0.0 - 4.0 (default 4.0, disabled)
- `-cr <ratio>`: Height-to-width ratio for characters (default 2.0)
- `--retro-colors`: Uses 3-bit colors for pixels.

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with default dimensions
./ascii-view examples/puffin.jpg

# Specify custom dimensions
./ascii-view examples/waterfall.jpg -mw 120 -mh 60

# Specify edge threshold
./ascii-view examples/black-and-white.jpg -et 2.5

# Specify character aspect ratio
./ascii-view examples/cacti.jpg -cr 1.7
```

### Suggestions for getting good looking results
1. If you make your font size smaller, you can make the pictures larger
2. The results are limited by your terminal's colour scheme
3. If you squint your eyes the images look great!

## How It Works

1. **Image loading**: Uses stb_image to load various image formats
2. **Aspect ratio correction**: Accounts for terminal character dimensions (typically ~2:1 height to width ratio[^1])
3. **Area averaging**: When downsampling, averages pixel values in rectangular regions for smooth results
4. **Color analysis**: Converts RGB pixels to HSV color space to determine:
   - **Hue**: Maps to ANSI terminal colors (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow)
   - **Saturation**: Low saturation pixels display as white
   - **Value**: Used to calculate brightness for ASCII character selection
5. **ASCII mapping**: Maps brightness levels to ASCII characters: ` .-=+*x#$&X@`
6. **Edge enhancement**: Finds edges and angles with a Sobel filter, enhances edges with `_/|\`

[^1]: Some terminals support the ability to extract the exact font ratio, but others don't. For the time being we assume a 2:1 ratio, with ability to change it through the `-cr` option.
